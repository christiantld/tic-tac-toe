# Personal Considerations
This was my first personal project, it's main goal was to put into practice some of the new concepts html, css and JS that I've learned so far. It was a bit trick to figure it out how to write the winning conditions, so it was a good oportunity to test my search skills as well. It is my intention to come back to this project and implement some features like real time for multiplayer mode and some kind of AI to single player mode.
